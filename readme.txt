Do you ever wonder why your blog is running so slow?  This simple plugin was written to help web developers identify a common problem with many WordPress installations: Query abuse.  By using this plugin, you can compare the database query counts load times directly on your website via a small and friendly box in the bottom-right corner of your screen. Use WP Query Counter to aid in your plugin's development.  Efficient code is fast code!

This  plugin is no longer maintained.  While it may continue to work into the future, I would recommend taking a look at a derivative plugin, [WP Page Load Stats](http://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-page-load-stats/), written and supported by [Mike Jolley](http://mikejolley.com/projects/wp-page-load-stats/).
